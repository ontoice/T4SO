# T4SO
T4SO(Ontology of Type IV Secretion Systems) is aimed at the systematic and logic representation of Type IV Secretion Systems.

Type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) are versatile, bacterial membrane-spanning apparatuses, composed of diverse structural units, which mediate both genetic exchange and the delivery of effector proteins to target eukaryotic cells. We generated a web-based database called SecReT4 (https://db-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/SecReT4/), which archived information derived from the reported literature and in silico predictions of T4SSs and cognate effectors in bacteria. The T4SO is developed to first systematically represent the T4SS information collected in the database.
